DebugLens is an AI-driven debugging tool where user can type a scenario description and get a step by step debugging session.
 - debugger looks like traditional IDE debugger
 - user can set breakpoints, step through execution, and inspect variables in a simplified, high-level format.
 - main difference from traditional debugger is that, firt the code itself that to be debugged for the scenario is generated by llm itself, givne the prompt
 - once the debugging session is started, llm itself generates all the necessary debug info, like variable context, execution trace etc
 - at each debugging step, it also shows concept panel, where it explains the concept of the step, and source of the step
 - remember, generated code and debug info, is mainly to look into how source code is implemented, for the scenario, we are talking about not how it being used. this is at most important to remember
